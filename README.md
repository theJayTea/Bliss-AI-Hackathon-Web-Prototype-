# The Bliss Platform

Bliss AI tackles the systemic educational inequity that disadvantages millions of children worldwide. In India alone, insufficient access to after-school academic support severely hinders the potential of children from impoverished backgrounds. While government-run or NGO-operated schools offer valuable in-class instruction, these children lack the resources for private tutoring enjoyed by their more affluent peers. This disparity exacerbates an existing gap in learning outcomes, creating a cycle where educational disadvantage perpetuates socioeconomic hardship.
Furthermore, a stark lack of personalized attention hinders even well-intentioned efforts.  Educators in underfunded schools are overburdened, and unable to tailor their approach to each student's needs.  This is particularly damaging for children with learning difficulties or those from non-literate households, who lack educational support within their families.

# Here's how the Bliss platform works:

#The AI Tutor:
At the heart of Bliss platform is Bliss AI, a cutting-edge tutoring system that adapts to each student's needs. It understands each child's curriculum, grade level, language preferences, and learning difficulties. This allows Bliss AI to communicate in the way the student learns best, breaking down complex subjects into simple explanations and fostering critical thinking rather than just providing answers.

   Accessibility:
Bliss AI eliminates barriers. Non-literate students can speak in their native tongue, and the platform supports diverse learning styles and challenges and input methods. To enhance understanding, students can upload pictures of textbooks or their work; Bliss AI will then provide tailored guidance.

   Educator Partnership:
Bliss AI isn't a replacement for teachers; it's a powerful extension. Educators on their end provide input on a student's learning profile (this is something the face-to-face educator would know best, making them a cornerstone of enabling Bliss AI to be successful outside the classroom), enabling Bliss AI to offer truly personalized support outside the classroom.



# Beyond Tutoring — the Bliss platform goes further to aid after school education:
   
➡️ Marks Insight Tool: Students enter their grades, and AI analyzes their performance to offer tailored insights for improvement. For educators, this provides class-wide trends and actionable data.

➡️ AI Schedule Creator: This feature helps students build study timetables based on their target areas, prioritizing where they need the most support.

➡️ Gamified To-Do List: Subject-specific tasks (which can be set by educators) are presented as a rewarding game, motivating students with daily goals.

# Technology:
Bliss AI harnesses the power of leading-edge language models (like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro with large context sizes) with advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques. This unique approach, tailored to education, ensures Bliss AI delivers effective explanations and adapts to each child. It will always know, for instance, the entire syllabus focus of the educational program they are undergoing to aid best (along with the other context of the child); this is possible using RAG, and the bleeding-edge of extreme context lengths (like in Gemini 1.5 Pro).
