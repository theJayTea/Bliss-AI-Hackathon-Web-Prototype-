Poverty has adverse effects on children all over the world, and it doesn’t discriminate. In almost every case, those in poverty are irrevocably damaged due to their lack of quality education — a severe breach to their basic human right. To help address this and provide millions an opportunity to quality education, we plan to create a web-based mobile application.

Our project is a system that will connect volunteer tutors from around the world with underprivileged children, allowing them to:

 1. Set **online meetings** to teach a particular concept or topic through
    video chats.
 2. Create **tests and assignments** for children after meetings (for
    complete concept clarity).

And, in the event that an appropriate tutor isn’t available, our third feature, a **heavily customized LLM (GPT 4-based) called `Bliss` will act as a substitute tutor**. This AI model will be prompt engineered to teach effectively and will be customized to respond in context of the child’s grade, language, curriculum, and more.
